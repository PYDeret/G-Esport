# G-esport

## What is G-esport ?

**G-esport** is a community project, which aims to bring together a community of **gamers** around a **competition**.<br/>
It is a platform for administering **videos games tournaments** for a community.<br/>
Indeed, this platform wants to be "**on demand only**", the **administrators** must invite the new members and they will be able to **create teams** and **participate** in the tournaments, the **administrators** must also **create the tournaments** and can also set up a **system of reward**.
